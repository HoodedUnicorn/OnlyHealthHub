# The HealthHub App

** FOR CHANGES GO TO CHANGELOG.md SINCE IT WAS MOVED FROM HERE TO GIVE A BETTER README **

So for school we had to come up with a project, a group initiative mixing our different educations: Nursing, Engineering and ICT. 
We got a problem that a nursing student encountered on her internship, and we had to device a solution.

So what we are building would I keep confidential, but for our prototype I would build an app.

Knowing mostly about servers, I researched the best language and went for it: Javascript!

Okay, laughing over. I turned to a friend who recommended Java.
So me going to Java and learning it.

So when building the app, I first thought: "Man, what a mountainous task", but I thought too hard and picked a template.
When following the changes in CHANGELOG.md you can follow what I did.

I hope you had a great time reading.
